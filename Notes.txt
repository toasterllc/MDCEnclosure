    - How do we handle the enclosure contacting the board around the lens holder?
        - We wanted it to contact to block light from the image sensor
        - Options
            - Use gasket instead of having aluminum protrusion contact board directly
            - Don't have it contact, and block light around other entrances (motion sensor, USB receptacle)
    
    - Move bottom board mount closer to STM32 to give USB-C receptacle clearance to be inserted
    
    - Fix USB-C receptacle cutout
    
    - Add taps to board mount holes
    
    - Add hole+tap to backplate mount
        - Use a bigger hole than Rev1?
    
    - Backplate: add protrusion to side of backplate mount to insert into side wall of enclosure
    
    - Backplate: add slot to sidewall for backplate protrusion to insert into
    
    - Move parts (resistors, capacitors) further away front mount points on front of board
        - We want more safety margin near mount points
    
    
    
    √ Fill gap between backplate mount point and inside lens protrusion
    
    √ Backplate: make backplate mount point extend the entire length of the sidewall, to ease manufacturing
