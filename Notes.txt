- Rev2 Todo
    
    - Add fingernail indentation
    
    - Make motion sensor hole a little smaller
    
    - Research dovetail gaps and tweak them if necessary
        - Probably necessary because currently the gap (across both sides, combined) is 0.3mm
    
    - Add hole for LED
    
    - Update logo to use correct font
    
    - Compare cost with/without logo
    
    - Compare cost with/without fillet edges on frontplate
    
    - Make sure mount holes match board mount holes
        - Overlay PCB to verify
    
    
    
    √ Implement dovetail slot
    
    √ Implement backplate dovetail design
    
    √ Fix USB-C receptacle cutout
    
    √ Clean up mount point parameter names (we only have 3 mount points now, so we shouldn't have 4 mount point params)
    
    √ Lens hole: don't thread entire length, so that threads don't impact o-ring
    
    √ Drill mount point holes deeper
    
    √ Add slot to hold inside lens protrusion o-ring
    
    X Adjust position of USB-C receptacle cutout by looking at current prototype
        X Keep existing design for now, reasses once we get CNC'd aluminum
    
    X Backplate: add protrusion to side of backplate mount to insert into side wall of enclosure
        X No longer necessary due to backplate dovetail design
    
    X Backplate: add slot to sidewall for backplate protrusion to insert into
        X No longer necessary due to backplate dovetail design
    
    X Add hole+tap to backplate mount
        - Use a bigger hole than Rev1?
        X No longer necessary due to backplate dovetail design
    
    √ How do we handle the enclosure contacting the board around the lens holder?
        - We wanted it to contact to block light from the image sensor
        - Options
            - Use o-ring/gasket instead of having aluminum protrusion contact board directly
            - Don't have it contact, and block light around other entrances (motion sensor, USB receptacle)
        √ O-ring option seems like the easiest
    
    √ Add taps to board mount holes
    
    X Move bottom board mount closer to STM32 to give USB-C receptacle clearance to be inserted
        X No longer necessary because we removed the bottom board mount
    
    √ Fill gap between backplate mount point and inside lens protrusion
    
    √ Backplate: make backplate mount point extend the entire length of the sidewall, to ease manufacturing
